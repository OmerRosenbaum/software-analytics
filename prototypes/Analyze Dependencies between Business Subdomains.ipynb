    "# Introduction\n",
    "In [Carola Lilienthal](https://twitter.com/cairolali)'s talk about architecture and technical debt at [Herbstcampus 2017](https://www.herbstcampus.de/veranstaltung-5926-keynote-i%3A-architektur-f%C3%BCr-unser-gehirn.html?id=5926), I was reminded that I wanted to implement some of the examples of her book \"[Long-lived software systems](http://www.llsa.de/)\" (available only in German) with the structural analysis tool [jQAssistant](https://jqassistant.org/). Especially the visualizations of the dependencies between different business subdomains seemed like a great starting point to try out some stuff. In Carola's book, there are visualization like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](resources/analyze_business_domain_dependencies.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization was created by using [SotoGraph](https://www.hello2morrow.com/products/sotograph), a tool for software architecture validation. It shows the user-defined subdomains as well as the relationships between them. The green connections between the modules show the downward dependencies to other modules and the red one the upward dependencies. This visualization can help if you want to further modularize your system towards microservices or to identify unwanted dependencies between modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Carola's talk (aka during the rest of the conference's morning), I immediately created the [Java Type Dependency Analysis](https://www.feststelltaste.de/java-type-dependency-analysis/) with visualizations in [D3](https://d3js.org/). During coding, I realized that there it is only a small step to analyze dependencies between business domains. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's missing is the information which type belong to which business subdomain. We'll find out now!"

    "# A simple case study\n",
    "Once, I've developed a party planning application called DropOver (that didn't go live, but that's another story) within a small team. We wrote that web application in Java and paid especially attention to structuring the code along the business' subdomain \"partying\". This led to this package structure that resembles the main parts of the application:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./resources/dropover_package_structure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The application's main entry point is a `site` for a party including location, time, the site's `creator` and so on. A user can `comment` on a site as well as add some specific widgets like `todo` lists, `scheduling` or `files` upload and also gets notified by the `mail` feature. And there is a special package `framework` where all the cross-cutting concerns are placed like the dependency injection configuration or common, technical software elements for persisting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main point to take away here is that it's easy to determine the business subdomain for a software element thanks to the alignment of the package structure along the business' subdomain: It's the 3rd position in the Java package name: \n",
    "\n",
    "`at.dropover.`**`<subdomain>`**`.`\n",
    "\n",
    "This information can easily be used to retrieve the information about the subdomain."

    "I've built the web application, scanned the software artifact (a standard JAR file that we created for integration testing purposes) with the jQAssistant command line tool (with `jqassistant.sh scan -f dropover-classes.jar` in this case) and started the server (with `jqassistant.sh server`). Taking a look at the accompanied Neo4j browser, we can see the graph that jQAssistant stored in Neo4j. E. g. we can display the relationship between the JAR file and the contained Java types:\n",

The first four make perfect sense because if you create one of those content types in the application, they are created by some person (they are \"personalized\" content). Whereas `todo` and `files` are user agnostic content types and thus don't have any dependencies on `creator` (well, that's a tricky situation in retrospect; wouldn't do that now). \n",

In the pseudo subdomain `framework`, there are some base classes for all the data objects that are persistent in a data store. That explains the outbound dependency of `creator`. The dependencies from `framework` to `creator` are needed for the central dependency injection configuration of the application. So this seems reasonable as well but also can be improved by further dividing the big `framework` package to smaller, more specific ones.\n",
