    "\n",
    "Version control repositories like CVS, Subversion or Git store rich evolution information about a software project. In this project, you'll be challenged to read in, clean up and visualize a real world Git log dataset of the Linux kernel. With almost 700k commits and thousands of contributors (find out the exact number in this project ;-) ) there are many little data cleaning and wrangling challenges that you'll encounter. But you'll also gain insights about the contribution habits of the committers over the last 15 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this Project, you need to be familiar with Pandas `DataFrame`, especially the `read_csv` and `groupby` functions as well as working with time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Datasets used ####\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using a plain Git log file of the [Linux kernel mirror on GitHub](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumed student background ####\n",
    "\n",
    "* Students will exploit the `DataFrame.read_csv()` function a little bit in this mini tutorial by using parameters that are very useful for processing header-less and compressed CSV files.\n",
    "* Next, some basic data cleaning skills are necessary. There are wrong timestamps as well as missing values in the dataset. This requires a simple `fillna()` and a filtering based on `DateTimeIndex`es. There are also multiple author names for on person in the dataset. Students should spot and correct these data problems for the TOP 5 committers.\n",
    "* Last, we `groupby()` the `DataFrame` by months and visualize the result via a `matplotlib` `bar` chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, this is an entry level analysis that includes also information about how to get a Git log from your repository."

Since its humble beginning in 1991, this kernel has evolved into a best-of-breed operating system component which runs on pocket-sized digital music players, desktop PCs, the largest supercomputers in existence, and all types of systems in between. It is a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for almost any situation.\n",
