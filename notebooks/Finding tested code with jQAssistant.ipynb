I've just added jQAssistant as a Maven plugin to my project's Maven build ([see here for a mini tutorial](https://github.com/JavaOnAutobahn/spring-petclinic/blob/master/readme.md)). The structures of this application are stored by jQAssistant in a property graph within the graph database [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/). A subgraph with the structural information that's relevant for our purposes looks like this:\n",

    "We can see the scanned software entities like Java types (red) or methods (blue) as well their relationships with each other. We can now explore the database's content with the included Neo4j browser frontend or access the data with a programming language. I use Python (the programming language we'll write our analysis later on) with the `py2neo` module (the bridge between Python and Neo4j). The information we need can be retrieved by creating and executing a Cypher query (explained in the following) &ndash; Neo4j's language for accessing information in the property graph.\n",
