    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this blog post, I want to show how you can get a first impression on how you can cut a monolithic application into separated components that make sense from a business' perspective. This method can help you to identify meaningful Bounded Contexts (source code that has a high conceptual cohesion in means of business terminology) for your application that should follow a [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design).\n",
    "\n",
    "We achieve this with a nice [D3 chord visualization (created by Pasha, licensed under GPL 3.0)](http://bl.ocks.org/NPashaP/ba4c802d5ef68f70c019a9706f77ebf1) combined with [jQAssistant](http://buschmais.github.io/jqassistant/doc/1.3.0/#_overview) / [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph analysis. jQAssistant can scan your Java application and store a graph of your software in a Neo4j graph database. This graph can then be enriched with [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher) to get additional nodes and relationships as well as queried as you need it &ndash; for your specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quickly get started, there is already a nice showcase project on GitHub that we can use to start immediately &ndash; the [\"jQAssistanterized\" version of Spring PetClinic](https://github.com/buschmais/spring-petclinic). Just clone this repository and build it with the [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) command `mvn clean install -DskipTests`. I also wrote about how one can [build a higher level view of the source code](https://www.feststelltaste.de/building-higher-level-abstractions-of-source-code/) as well as [analyzing dependencies between Java source code](https://www.feststelltaste.de/analyze-dependencies-between-business-subdomains/).\n",

    "# Marking components in code\n",
    "In this section, we want to find out components in our application that would probably be suited for Bounded Contexts. The Spring PetClinic project already comes with some user-defined queries for subdomains (the \"concept\" `business:Subdomain` that's defined in the [self-validating, living architecture documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buschmais/spring-petclinic/master/jqassistant/business.adoc)) that are derived from naming conventions of some Java types. That means that there is already a relationship between source code and the business' concepts existing &ndash; this will fit for our purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can query that graph directly via Python and [py2neo](http://py2neo.org/v3/) to get the data in a JSON format from Neo4j. For effectiveness reasons (and a nice inline, tabular visualization as well), we wrap that result in a [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame for further processing."
