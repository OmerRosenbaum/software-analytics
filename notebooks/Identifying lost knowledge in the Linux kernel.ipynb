    "Knowing all about the software system we are developing is valuable, but too often a rare situation we are facing today. In times of software development experts shortages and stressful software projects, high turnover in teams leads quickly to lost knowledge about the source code (&lt;scrumcasm&gt;And who needs to document? We do Scrum!&lt;/scrumcasm&gt;).\n",

It really did its job. But after my experiences from a Subversion to Git migration (where I, who guessed, ensured the quality of the migrated data :-) ), I've found another neat idea for another model to find lost knowledge."

    "# The Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "First: How do you define knowledge about your code? We could get into a deep philosophical discussion about what knowledge is and if there is such a thing as knowledge (invite to a beer if you want to start this discourse ;-)). But let's look at it from a developer's point of view: E. g. in my case, every time I want to know who could possibly know something about a code line written, for example, for this piece of code (the meaning of the source code is irrelevant here),\n",
    "\n",
    "![](resources/blame_game_source.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm catching myself in using the <strike>blame</strike> appraisal features of version control systems heavily. This feature calculates the latest change for each line. The resulting view gives me very helpful hints about what changes in a source code line happened recently\n",
    "\n",
    "![](resources/blame_game_annotate1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "with plenty of information about who and when this change occurred for each source code line.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](resources/blame_game_annotate2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With these results, I can take a look at the author of the code and the time stamp of the code change. This gives me enough hints about the circumstances in which the code change happened as well as the answer to the question if the original author could still possibly know anything about the source code line. For the latter, the answer is highly dependent on the recency of a code change. Here, I'm using Eagleson's law as a heuristic:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"de\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Eagleson&#39;s Law: Any code of your own that you haven&#39;t looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else.</p>&mdash; Programming Wisdom (@CodeWisdom) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CodeWisdom/status/940007477642432514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Dezember 10th 2017</a></blockquote>\n",
    "<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the code change is older than six months, it's very likely that the knowledge about the source code line is lost completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there we have it: A reasonable model of code knowledge! If we would have this information for all source code files of our software project, we would be able to identify the areas in our software system with lost knowledge (and find out, if we are <strike>screwed</strike> in a challenging situation!).\n",

    "\n",
    "Getting the data is straightforward: We just need a software system that used a version control system like Git for managing the code changes. I choose the Git repository of Linux for this demonstration. The reason? It's big! In this repo, we have a snapshot of the last 13 years of Linux kernel development at our hand with over 750000 commits and some millions lines of source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can get our hands on the necessary data with the `git blame` command that we execute for each source code file in the repository. There is a nice little bash command that makes this happen for us:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "find . -type d -name \".git\" -prune -o -type f \\( -iname \"*.c\" -o -iname \"*.h\" \\) | xargs -n1 git blame -w -f\n",
    "```\n",

    "* the sha id of the commit\n",
    "* the relative path of the file\n",
    "* the name of the author\n",
    "* the commit timestamp\n",
    "* the source line number\n",
    "* the source code line itself\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you might ask: \"OK, wait a minute: 13 years of development efforts, with around 750000 commits and (spoiler alert!) 10235 source code files that sum up to 5.6 millions lines of code. Are you insane?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Well kind of. I hadn't thought that retrieving the data set would take so long. But in the end, I didn't care because I did the calculation on a Google Cloud Compute Engine, which was pretty busy for 11 hours on a n1-standard-1 CPU (which cost me 30 cents, donations welcome :-D):\n",

The nice and bad thing at the same time is, that the Linux kernel was developed internationally. This means fun with file encodings! It seems that every nation has its own way of encoding their special character sets. Especially when working with the author's names, it's really a PITA. You simply cannot read in the dataset with standard means. The universal weapon for this is to import data into a Pandas DataFrame with the encoding `latin-1` which seems to don't care if there are some weird characters in the data (but unfortunately, screwing up foreign characters, which is not so important in our case).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there is no good format for outputting the Git blame log in a way, that it's easy to process. There are some flags for machine-friendly output, but these are multi-line formats (which are...not very nice to work within Pandas). So in these cases, I like to <strike>eat</strike> get my data in a very raw format.

Couldn't I've just exported the really needed sub data set for the analysis? For Sure! But besides showing you what you can find out with this dataset, I wanted to show you that it's absolutely no problem to work with a 3 GB data set like we had. You don't need any Big Data tooling or set up a cluster for computations. With Pandas, e. g. I can execute this analysis on my six-year-old notebook. Period!"
