    "![](resources/java_type_dependency_analysis_dependency_pet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph contains the information about the dependencies of all software entities like Java classes or interfaces. This information is exactly what we need to create a Dependency Analysis between Java types. We have just to create the right Cypher query and format the result that it fits into the D3 visualization above."

    "# Getting the right Data\n",
    "What you need to do is to scan your software with jQAssistant to get the information about the dependencies between classes. Just download the demo project at https://github.com/buschmais/spring-petclinic, build it with Java & Maven (`mvn clean install`) and start the embedded Neo4j graph database with `mvn jqassistant:server` .\n",
    "\n",
    "With a running Neo4j database, we connect to it via  [py2neo](http://py2neo.org/v3/database.html) and get the relationship information between nodes. In this example, we want to retrieve the direct dependency between any Java type that belongs to our application:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We identify our application's `type`'s by using only artifacts that are contained in our project by using the corresponding node labels `Project` and `Artifact`.\n",
    "- We also filter out any test classes by skipping the non-relevant artifacts of the type `test-jar`.\n",
    "- With the remaining types, we search for all direct dependencies with the `DEPENDS_ON` relationship to the other types of our application. For reasons of completeness, we also provide the types that don't depend on any other type of our application. That's why we specify the `*0..1` parameter in the relationship.\n",
    "- Finally, we `COLLECT` all the dependencies for one type into a list (more exact, the `fqn` aka full qualified name of the type), because that's what the D3 visualization needs as input. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a dictionary with all the information needed for the D3 visualization."
